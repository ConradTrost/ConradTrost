### Howdy, and welcome to my GitHub! 

I am a Full Stack Web Developer professionally focused in [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). On the side, I'm learning about training neural networks in Python ([Keras](https://keras.io/)), and 3d modeling in JavaScript ([ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) and [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/)). 

I develop most websites using [React](https://reactjs.org/), specifically coupled with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). I use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, and I am currently building a [React Component Library](https://github.com/ConradTrost/react-component-lib) that I plan to utilize more in the future.
