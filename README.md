### Howdy, and welcome to my GitHub! 

#### Check out my [portfolio](http://trost.dev).
#### Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conradtrost/).

I'm currently learning **TypeScript** and **React.JS**.  

Current Project(s): 
  - Application using **React**, **GraphQL**, and TMDB API. Movie search engine that allows users to save a movie to their watchlist and add friends, with the ability to see their watchlist and add comments to movies.
  - Application incorporating **React.JS** and **Blockchain**, creating a fun way to exchange "ticks" or "internet points" between friends.  
  - Side project exploring **Three.JS** and **WebGL** to create animations based on third party API data -- more info coming soon!

[**Email me**](mailto:conrad@trost.dev?subject=[GitHub]) if you'd like to collaborate (or if you're interested in hiring me)!
