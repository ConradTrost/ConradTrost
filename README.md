### Howdy, welcome to my GitHub! 

I am currently a Software Engineer II at 7-Eleven, working on Angular standalone applications and microfrontends, NestJS microservices, Kafka integrations, AWS infrastructure, and more. I work primarily within an Nx Monorepo, and I specialize in creating seamless development processes leveraging Nx for CI/CD and automated testing.

My recent focus has been on enterprise architecture, specifically high-level integration of microservices and microfrontends.
