### Howdy, and welcome to my GitHub! 

#### Check out my [portfolio](http://trost.dev).

I'm currently learning **MongoDB** and **React.JS**.  

Current Project(s): 
  - Application incorporating **React.JS** and **Blockchain**, creating a fun way to exchange "ticks" or "internet points" between friends.  
  - Side project exploring **Three.JS** and **WebGL** to create animations based on third party API data -- more info coming soon!
  - I am also planning on switching my porfolio from vanilla JavaScript to **Handlebars.JS** template to organize everything.

[**Email me**](mailto:conrad@trost.dev?subject=[GitHub]) if you'd like to collaborate (or if you're interested in hiring me)!
