### Howdy, and welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently learning **TypeScript**, **Gatsby.js**, and **Tailwind.css**  

Current Project(s): 
  - Ecommerce website built with **Next.js**, **Strapi CMS**, **Tailwind.css**, and **Stripe SDK**.
  - Application using **React**, **GraphQL**, and TMDB API. Movie search engine that allows users to save a movie to their watchlist and add friends, with the ability to see their watchlist and add comments to movies.
  - Application incorporating **React.JS** and **Blockchain**, creating a fun way to exchange "ticks" or "internet points" between friends.  
  - Side project exploring **Three.JS** and **WebGL** to create animations based on third party API data -- more info coming soon!
